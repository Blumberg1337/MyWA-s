-- for my understanding it's best to load weakauras for a specific ingame character
-- this way, you can fit this weakaura into your custom character's weakaura if you have one
-- ...like only mrogue related stuff showing blade flurry cd, slice'n'dice uptime, etc.
-- so my advice is to copy this weakaura per character and set your character's name here accordingly

playerNameRealm = "<your character's name and realm>"
